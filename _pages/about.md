Welcome to my webpage! I am a theoretical physicist working at The Ohio State University.

My research interest lies in Condensed Matter Physics, with a primary focus on understanding strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. Using advanced analytical and numerical techniques, I explore a broad area in condensed matter physics, covering topics like superconductivity, transport, many-body localization, etc. Apart from working on purely theoretical questions, I also enjoy collaborating with experimentalists.

Some of the specific topics of my research are:
* Superconductivity in thin-films and nanowires: Role of disorder and fluctuations
* Quantum transport theory: Calculation of Hall, thermopower, Nernst coefficients
* Quantum Hall Effects
* Entanglement, thermalization and Many-body localization (MBL)
* Quantum oscillations in Kondo insulators
* Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and Large-N theories
* Quantum criticality in compressible lattice; Renormalization Group (RG) analysis
