I am a Postdoctoral Researcher working at the Physics Department of the Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus (OH), USA. 

My research interest is in Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics, with a primary focus on understanding the intriguing physics of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. Using advanced analytical and numerical techniques, I explore a broad area in condensed matter physics, covering topics like superconductivity, transport, many-body localization, etc. Apart from working on purely theoretical questions, I also enjoy collaborating with experimentalists.
