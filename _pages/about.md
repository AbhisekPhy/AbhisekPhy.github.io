I am a Postdoctoral Researcher working at the Physics Department of the Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus (OH), USA. 

My research interest is in Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics, with a primary focus on understanding the intriguing physics of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. Using advanced analytical and numerical techniques, I explore a broad area in condensed matter physics, covering topics like superconductivity, transport, many-body localization, etc. Apart from working on purely theoretical questions, I also enjoy collaborating with experimentalists.

Some specific areas of my research are:
* Disordered superconductivity and their collective excitations (Higgs, Goldstone modes)
* Transport and thermopower properties of multi-band and strongly correlated systems
* SYK (Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev) interactions and quantum oscillations in Kondo insulators
* Quantum Hall effect in trilayer graphene and role of electronic correlations
* Many-body localization (MBL) in spin systems
* Quantum criticality in presence of acoustic phonons
