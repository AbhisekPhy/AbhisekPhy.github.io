I am Postdoctoral Researcher working at the Physics department of the Ohio State Uinversity. My research interest is broad. Using various advanced analytical and numerical techniques, I explore a broad area in condensed matter physics, covering topics like superconductivity, transport, many-body localization, etc. I also enjoy working in experimental collaborations.
