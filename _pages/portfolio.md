## Disordered superconductors and their collective modes (Higgs, Goldstone)
One of the most fascinating examples of the interplay between interaction and localization is the destruction of superconductivity with increasing disorder in thin-films, resulting in the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT). This transition is driven by both phase (Goldstone) and amplitude (Higgs) fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter that are the key low-energy collective excitations. The single particle gap remains while the it fills up (instead of closing) with temperature. Using Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the disordered -U Hubbard model we study  

Using functional integral and Gaussian fluctuation theory, In these disordered superconductors, we have constructed two-particle density of states which include both Higgs and Goldstone fluctuations, and studied their evolution with disorder. We made testable predictions for superconducting puddles, probed by scanning Josephson spectroscopy (SJS) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). For momentum-resolved spectral functions, we found that disorder creates a sub-gap Higgs mode and flattens the Goldstone mode. In the presence of weak disorder, the Higgs mode remains spectrally separated from the Goldstone mode for a large range of temperatures, thereby making it a possible candidate to observe in energy-resolved spectroscopies.

Future explorations will include study of unconventional superconductivity, as seen in low-density heterostructure-based SCs, such as , which show promise in candidate materials for quantum computations due to high kinetic inductances.

## Transport properties (Hall, thermopower/Seeback) of semimetals and interacting systems
The Hall coefficient (RH ) has been traditionally used to measure the charge carrier density in transport measurements, via the Drude relation. However, this relation may break down in semimetals due to the presence of multiple bands and intriguing Fermi surface topology. By using a recently developed formula [8] written in terms of thermodynamic susceptibilities, which can avoid the complications of coupled Boltzmann equations in multi-band Hamiltonians, we have calculated the deviation of RH from the Drude relation in spin-split semiconductor bands, as well as Weyl and nodal-line semimetals [9].
Moreover, we proposed experiments to measure these deviations. 

We also calculated the Hall coefficient of strongly interacting systems, by using high temperature series expansion of the t-J model, supplemented by DQMC simulations of the Hubbard model [10]. Our calculation explains the observation of “Hall anomalies”, i.e. abrupt changes in sign and magnitude of RH in high temperature cuprates [11]. A similar anomaly has also been observed in the thermopower measurements (thermoelectric power, or the Seebeck coefficient S) [12,13]. Using thermodynamic Kelvin formula [14] we perform DQMC simulations in the Hubbard model and calculated the Seebeck coefficient [15]. Our results captured strong dependence of S on lattice geometry, as well as nontrivial doping dependent behavior with strong interactions, as seen in cuprate experiments.


## Superconductivity in ionic Hubbard model (IHM)
The ionic Hubbard model is defined on a bipartite lattice, where, in addition to the kinetic energy and the local Hubbard repulsion terms, the fermions also feel a constant potential difference between the two sublattices (ionic potential). This model is challenging to solve in the limit when the staggered ionic potential competes with Hubbard repulsion term, opening up a window of charge fluctuations. Using a strong-coupling expansion (Schrieffer-Wolff transformation) we have derived an effective low-energy dimer-dipole Hamiltonian in this limit, and employed parton mean-field theory in presence of both double occupancy and holes to study the ground state properties of this model. Calculating of superfluid stiffness shows the appearance of a superconducting phase, which can be detected in the ultra-cold atom experiments.
