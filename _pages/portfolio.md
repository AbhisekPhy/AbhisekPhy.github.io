## Superconductivity in ionic Hubbard model (IHM)
The ionic Hubbard model is defined on a bipartite lattice, where, in addition to the kinetic energy and the local Hubbard repulsion terms, the fermions also feel a constant potential difference between the two sublattices (ionic potential). This model is challenging to solve in the limit when the staggered ionic potential competes with Hubbard repulsion term, opening up a window of charge fluctuations. Using a strong-coupling expansion (Schrieffer-Wolff transformation) we have derived an effective low-energy dimer-dipole Hamiltonian in this limit, and employed parton mean-field theory in presence of both double occupancy and holes to study the ground state properties of this model. Calculating of superfluid stiffness shows the appearance of a superconducting phase, which can be detected in the ultra-cold atom experiments.
