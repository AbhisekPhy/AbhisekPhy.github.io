## Disordered superconductors and their collective modes (Higgs, Goldstone)
One of the most fascinating examples of the interplay between interaction and localization is the destruction of superconductivity with increasing disorder in thin-films, resulting in the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT). Using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations on the disordered fermionic Hubbard model that includes thermal and quantum fluctuations, we provide a detailed description of different phases in these systems, their transition and critical behavior at finite temperature. We show that while the single-particle density of states (DOS) remains gapped across the transition, the low-energy excitations of this system are the dynamical fluctuations of the amplitude (Higgs) and phase (Goldstone mode) of the superconducting order parameter. With increase in temperature, the gap does not close, instead it fills up which is of recent experimental interest conventional superconductors, as well as in cuprates.

To understand the behavior of the Higgs and the Goldstone modes individually, we use functional integral formalism and bosonic Gaussian fluctuation theory.

This transition is driven by both phase (Goldstone) and amplitude (Higgs) fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter that are the key low-energy collective excitations. The single particle gap remains while the it fills up (instead of closing) with temperature. Using Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the disordered -U Hubbard model we study  

Using functional integral and Gaussian fluctuation theory, In these disordered superconductors, we have constructed two-particle density of states which include both Higgs and Goldstone fluctuations, and studied their evolution with disorder. We made testable predictions for superconducting puddles, probed by scanning Josephson spectroscopy (SJS) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). For momentum-resolved spectral functions, we found that disorder creates a sub-gap Higgs mode and flattens the Goldstone mode. In the presence of weak disorder, the Higgs mode remains spectrally separated from the Goldstone mode for a large range of temperatures, thereby making it a possible candidate to observe in energy-resolved spectroscopies.

Future explorations will include study of unconventional superconductivity, as seen in low-density heterostructure-based SCs, such as , which show promise in candidate materials for quantum computations due to high kinetic inductances.

## Transport properties (Hall, Seebeck coefficients) of semimetals and interacting systems
The Hall coefficient ($R_H$) has been traditionally used to measure the charge carrier density in transport measurements, via the Drude relation $R_H\sim \frac{1}{n}$. However, this relation may break down in semimetals due to the presence of multiple bands and intriguing Fermi surface topology. Multiband conductivity calculations involve coupled Boltzmann equations with interband collision integrals which are quite challenging. We can avoid this difficulty by using a recently developed Hall coefficient formula [Auerbach et al] written in terms of thermodynamic susceptibilities. We have calculated the deviation of $R_H$ from the Drude relation in spin-split semiconductor bands, as well as Weyl and nodal-line semimetals [Samanta et al]. We proposed experiments to measure these deviations. 

In interacting systems, we have calculated $R_H$ over a large range of temperatures between the antiferromagnetic interaction and the Mott gap scales, by using high-temperature expansion of the t-J model, supplemented by DQMC simulations of the strongly interacting Hubbard model. Our calculation explains the observation of "Hall anomalies" in experiments, i.e. abrupt changes in sign and magnitude of $R_H$ in high temperature cuprates. My current research interest is to explore the thermopower properties (Seebeck) of several multi-band models, semimetals and interacting systems, with the recent proposal of semimetals as good candidate of efficient thermoelectric materials and anomalies in cuprate experiments.

Our calculation explains the observation of "Hall anomalies", i.e. abrupt changes in sign and magnitude of $R_H$ in high temperature cuprates. A similar anomaly has also been observed in the thermopower measurements (thermoelectric power, or the Seebeck coefficient S) [12,13]. Using thermodynamic Kelvin formula [14] we perform DQMC simulations in the Hubbard model and calculated the Seebeck coefficient [15]. Our results captured strong dependence of S on lattice geometry, as well as nontrivial doping dependent behavior with strong interactions, as seen in cuprate experiments.

hence is amenable to well-controlled statistical mechanics methods.

## Effect of interactions on the Quantum Oscillations (QO) in Kondo insulator
Kondo insulators, such as SmB6 or YbB$x_{12}$, are found to exhibit quantum oscillations in density of states (Shubnikov deHass/SdH) and magnetization (deHass van Alphen/dHvA), even in absence of a Fermi surface. Recently, it has been shown [Panda et al] in a mean-field approach (Hybridization-gap insulators) that SdH and dHvA oscillations in such systems show different frequencies and different field and temperature-dependent amplitudes, in marked contrast with metals. Kondo insulators are, how- ever, strongly correlated systems where interaction effects cannot be a priori ignored. We generalize the periodic Anderson model with Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK)-like interactions, where the large-N limit allows us to control the calculation. We study the fate of quantum oscillations in Kondo insulators in this solvable limit. We find that the QO frequencies are not renormalized by interactions. The QO amplitudes show a remarkable difference: the dHvA amplitude is essentially unaffected by interaction, while the SdH amplitude is strongly enhanced.

## Superconductivity in ionic Hubbard model (IHM)
The ionic Hubbard model is defined on a bipartite lattice, where, in addition to the kinetic energy and the local Hubbard repulsion terms, the fermions also feel a constant potential difference between the two sublattices (ionic potential). This model is challenging to solve in the limit when the staggered ionic potential competes with Hubbard repulsion term, opening up a window of charge fluctuations. Using a strong-coupling expansion (Schrieffer-Wolff transformation) we have derived an effective low-energy dimer-dipole Hamiltonian in this limit, and employed parton mean-field theory in presence of both double occupancy and holes to study the ground state properties of this model. Calculating of superfluid stiffness shows the appearance of a superconducting phase, which can be detected in the ultra-cold atom experiments.
