## Collective modes in disorder superconductors
One of the most fascinating examples of the interplay between interaction and localization is the destruction of superconductivity with increasing disorder in thin-films, resulting in the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT). This transition is driven by both phase (Goldstone) and amplitude (Higgs) fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter that are the key low-energy collective excitations. In these disordered superconductors, we have constructed two-particle density of states which include both Higgs and Goldstone fluctuations, and studied their evolution with disorder. We made testable predictions for superconducting puddles, probed by scanning Josephson spectroscopy (SJS) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). For momentum-resolved spectral functions, we found that disorder creates a sub-gap Higgs mode and flattens the Goldstone mode. In the presence of weak disorder, the Higgs mode remains spectrally separated from the Goldstone mode for a large range of temperatures, thereby making it a possible candidate to observe in energy-resolved spectroscopies.

## Superconductivity in ionic Hubbard model (IHM)
The ionic Hubbard model is defined on a bipartite lattice, where, in addition to the kinetic energy and the local Hubbard repulsion terms, the fermions also feel a constant potential difference between the two sublattices (ionic potential). This model is challenging to solve in the limit when the staggered ionic potential competes with Hubbard repulsion term, opening up a window of charge fluctuations. Using a strong-coupling expansion (Schrieffer-Wolff transformation) we have derived an effective low-energy dimer-dipole Hamiltonian in this limit, and employed parton mean-field theory in presence of both double occupancy and holes to study the ground state properties of this model. Calculating of superfluid stiffness shows the appearance of a superconducting phase, which can be detected in the ultra-cold atom experiments.
